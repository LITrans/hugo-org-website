Dr. Arash Kalatian worked at LiTrans as a PhD student from May 2017 to December 2020. During his PhD studies, Dr. Kalatian mainly focused on studying pedestrians’ behaviour, and in particular, their interactions with autonomous vehicles. He utilized novel data sources, i.e. virtual reality, Wi-Fi and LiDar, and developed a wide range of machine learning algorithms to detect, model and predict pedestrian behaviour in a futuristic context. In March 2021, Dr. Kalatian will be joining [Institute for Transport Studies](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport) at [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/) as a Research Fellow in Choice Modelling and Machine Learning. In his new role, Dr. Kalatian will be working with [Dr. Charisma Choudhury](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/staff/924/dr-charisma-choudhury) and [Dr. He Wang](http://drhewang.com/) on [NEXUS project](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/transport/news/article/5321/its-researcher-awarded-flagship-fellowship) to bring together choice modelling, ubiquitous computing and machine learning techniques to address the new challenges of mobility. He will have cross-university collaborations through the [Choice Modelling Centre](https://cmc.leeds.ac.uk/) and [Leeds Institute for Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/), as well as external partners including the [Asian Development Bank](https://www.adb.org/) and [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) - UK’s national centre for data science and artificial intelligence.
