Recent work by [Rafael Vasquez](https://litrans.ca/team/vasquez-r/), MASc student in Transportation Engineering, [Ryerson University](ryerson.ca) on socially-aware Automated Vehicles (AVs) is featured in [MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/613410/should-a-self-driving-car-protect-a-passenger-or-pedestrian-ideally-both/). Rafael used naturalistic data from VR experiments and deep reinforecment learning to train AVs that not only keeps passenger comfort in mind, but also the safety and convenience of pedestrians in urban environments.
