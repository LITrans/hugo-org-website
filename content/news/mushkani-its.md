Congratulations to Mehdi Meshkani who wins 3rd Prize in 2020 ITS Canada Essay Competition Award. This is an annual contest held by ITS Canada that promotes the ITS expertise, experience and interests of young researchers from Canadian Universities. Mehdi's essay titled: "A distributed ridehailing system in CAVs environment" served as an intersection between academia and real-world transportation issues. It integrated emergent technologies to develop more efficient on demand shared mobility system which is based on infrastructure to infrastructure (I2I) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communication.
