This is a call for participants to be involved in an exciting interdisciplinary transmedia project which seeks to use virtual reality to explore the interactions of drivers with autonomous vehicles.
The Laboratory of Innovations in Transportation (LiTrans) has developed a virtual reality environment which uses an immersive head mounted device, with motion and touch sensors to measure comfort and stress levels in a number of experimental settings. Participants will be asked to navigate and drive through the immersive virtual reality environment in multiple scenarios. The total time of the experiment will take approximately 30 minutes. A questionnaire survey must be completed online before and after participating in the experiment.
