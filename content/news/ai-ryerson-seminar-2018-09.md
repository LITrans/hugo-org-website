## The use of learning approaches in modeling traffic
Presenter: Professor Mario Cools, University of Liège\\
Location: EPH111\\
Date: Thursday August 16, 2018. 11:00AM—12:00PM

The presentation will tackle different examples of the use of learning
approaches in the field of transportation, in particular in the case of
transport modeling. First, the applications in the context of population
synthesis and activity pattern generation are illustrated.
Recent advances in agent-based micro-simulation modeling have further
highlighted the importance of a thorough full synthetic population procedure
for guaranteeing the correct characterization of real-world populations and
underlying travel demands. In this regard, we propose an integrated approach
including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and profiling-based
methods to capture the behavioral complexity and the great heterogeneity of
agents of the true population through representative micro-samples. The
population synthesis method is capable of building the joint distribution of
a given population with its corresponding marginal distributions using either
full or partial conditional probabilities or both of them simultaneously.
In particular, the estimation of socio-demographic or transport-related
variables and the characterization of daily activity-travel patterns are
included within the framework. The fully probabilistic structure based on
Markov Chains characterizing this framework makes it innovative compared to
standard activity-based models. Moreover, data stemming from the 2010 Belgian
ousehold Daily Travel Survey (BELDAM) are used to calibrate the modeling
framework. We illustrate that this framework effectively captures the
behavioral heterogeneity of travelers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
proposed framework is adequately adapted to meeting the demand for large-scale
micro-simulation scenarios of transportation and urban systems. Afterwards, a
new Singular Value Decomposition-Latent Dirichlet Allocation (SVD-LDA) model
will be presented to detect congestion patterns. The model is calibrated based
on the taxi trip dataset, collected in the city of Chicago in 2016. The model
specifies the trends in terms of traffic congestion patterns, also called
topics in the literature. The main findings of this study reveal that, within
day, SVD-LDA succeeds in distinguishing traffic patterns in terms of peak and
off-peak hours with highly balanced topics. Furthermore, for day-to-day
patterns, the model highlights stable traffic patterns across days. This lack
of daily variability resulted in highly unbalanced share of topics.

### Biography

Mario Cools (Lier, 1982) holds a master degree in applied economics,
major quantitative business economics, minor operations research (University
of Antwerp, 2004) and a master degree in applied statistics (Hasselt University,
2005). After obtaining his statistics degree, he started working as a PhD
candidate at the Transportation Research Institute of Hasselt University,
where he obtained his PhD in transportation sciences in 2009. After having
continued his research as a post-doctoral researcher, Mario Cools was granted
a post-doctoral fellowship from the Research Foundation Flanders (FWO) in 2010.
Consequently, he worked at the KU Leuven Campus Brussels as an assistant
professor in the Faculty of Economics and Management, and 10% as assistant
professor the Faculty of Business Economics of Hasselt University. Currently,
Mario Cools is appointed as full-time associate professor at the Faculty of
Applied Sciences of the University of Liège. He is author and co-author of
different scientific publications in research domains such as travel behaviour,
transport policy and activity-based travel demand models.
