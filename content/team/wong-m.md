bio: "Melvin is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Laboratory of Innovations in Transportation at Ryerson University supervised by [Dr. Bilal Farooq](../farooq-b). Melvin's research explores how generative modelling and machine learning can impact travel behaviour analysis and how it changes the way we look at choice modelling. In particular, measuring heterogeneity in 'Big Data' and using deep learning methods for optimization of complex choice models.


Melvin graduated with his Bachelor in Engineering Degree with Honors from [Nanyang Technological University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.sg) in 2015 and began his Ph.D. with Dr. Bilal Farooq later that year. While at NTU, he participated in the NTU undergraduate research programme on the topic of machine learning and object detection in infrared surveillance images." # enter your short bio here (markdown format compatible)
