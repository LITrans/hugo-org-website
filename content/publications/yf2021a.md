abstract: "Ontology is the explicit and formal representation of the concepts in a domain and relations among them. Transportation science is a wide domain dealing with mobility over various complex and interconnected transportation systems, such as land, aviation, and maritime transport, and can take considerable advantage from ontology development. While several studies can be found in the recent literature, there exists a large potential to improve and develop a comprehensive smart mobility ontology. The current chapter aims to present different aspects of ontology development in general, such as ontology development methods, languages, tools, and software. Subsequently, it presents the currently available mobility-related ontologies developed across different domains, such as transportation, smart cities, goods mobility, and sensors. Current gaps in the available ontologies are identified, and future directions regarding ontology development are proposed that can incorporate the forthcoming autonomous and connected vehicles, mobility as a service (MaaS), and other disruptive transportation technologies and services."
