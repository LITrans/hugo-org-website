abstract: "Communication between vehicles and road infrastructure can enable more efficient use of the road network and hence reduce congestion in urban areas. This improvement can be enhanced by
distributed control due to its lighter computational load and higher reliability. Despite favourable impacts on traffic, little is known about the effects of such systems on near-road air quality. In
this study, an End-To-End (E2E) dynamic distributed routing algorithm in Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) was applied in downtown Toronto, to identify whether benefits to
network throughput were associated with lower near-road NO2 concentrations. We observe significant reductions in the emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) with increased penetration of
CAVs. Nonetheless, at times, the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) increased with higher CAVs. Besides, a higher frequency and severity of NO2 hot-spots were observed under a 100% CAV
scenario. Impacts of the proposed system on electric energy consumption in a full electric vehicle network were also investigated, indicating that the addition of CAVs that are electric did not
contribute to high energy savings. We propose that such new transformative technologies in transportation should be designed with air pollution and public health goals."
