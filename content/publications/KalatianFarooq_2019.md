abstract: "Due to their ubiquitous and pervasive nature, Wi-Fi networks have the potential to collect large-scale, low-cost, and disaggregate data on multimodal transportation. In this study, we develop a semi-supervised deep residual network (ResNet) framework to utilize Wi-Fi communications obtained from smartphones for the purpose of transportation mode detection. This framework is evaluated on data collected by Wi-Fi sensors located in a congested urban area in downtown Toronto. To tackle the intrinsic difficulties and costs associated with labelled data collection, we utilize ample amount of easily collected low-cost unlabelled data by implementing the semi-supervised part of the framework. By incorporating a ResNet architecture as the core of the framework, we take advantage of the high-level features not considered in the traditional machine learning frameworks. The proposed framework shows a promising performance on the collected data, with a prediction accuracy of 81.8% for walking, 82.5% for biking and 86.0% for the driving mode."
