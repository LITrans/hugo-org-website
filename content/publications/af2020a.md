abstract: "Traditionally, routing decisions have been based on minimizing travel time as the associated cost. Eco-routing considers the environmental aspects (e.g., emissions and fuel) as part of the travel cost to mitigate the undesirable impact of transportation systems on the environment. Unlike the exiting eco-routing review papers, this research work aims to provide a three-factor taxonomy at a more disaggregated level from the optimization prospective and map eco-routing studies to the proposed taxonomy. Furthermore, the strengths and weaknesses of the presented models are summarized. Our main findings include: a) a majority of studies optimized one objective at a time, b) the microscopic level of aggregation of the flow and emission/fuel models was rarely employed for large case studies, due to the associated complexity, and c) all of the reviewed studies were applied in a centralized routing system environment. In the near future when intelligent vehicles will be on the roads, a multi-objective distributed routing framework can be employed with a microscopic level of aggregation for both traffic and emission models, which is capable of operating on large-scale networks in real-time. Additionally, short-term spatio-temporal prediction of GHG cost is a crucial aspect to be tackled."
