abstract: "Blockchain has the potential to render the transaction of information more secure and transparent. Nowadays, transportation data are shared across multiple entities using heterogeneous mediums, from paper collected data to smartphone. Most of this data are stored in central servers that are susceptible to hacks. In some cases shady actors who may have access to such sources, share the mobility data with unwanted third parties. A multi-layered Blockchain framework for Smart Mobility Data-market (BSMD) is presented for addressing the associated privacy, security, management, and scalability challenges. Each participant shares their encrypted data to the blockchain network and can transact information with other participants as long as both parties agree to the transaction rules issued by the owner of the data. Data ownership, transparency, auditability and access control are the core principles of the proposed blockchain for smart mobility data-market. In a case study of real-time mobility data sharing, we demonstrate the performance of BSMD on a 370 nodes blockchain running on heterogeneous and geographicallyseparated devices communicating on a physical network. We also demonstrate how BSMD ensures the cybersecurity and privacy of individual by safeguarding against spoofing and message interception attacks and providing information access management control."
